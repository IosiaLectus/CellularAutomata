# CellularAutomata

This repo contains implementations of 1 and 2 dimensional cellular automata, with Moore neighborhoods and rules encoded as Wolfram codes, with the possibility of cells taking more than two states. It also contains a pygame based GUI for displaying and manipulating instances of these automata.
